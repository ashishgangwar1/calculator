🔍 How It Works
add_to_calculation(symbol) – Appends a number/operator to the input string

evaluate_calculation() – Evaluates the full expression using Python’s eval()

clear_field() – Clears the entire input

back_space() – Deletes the last character in the input

⚠️ Disclaimer
This calculator uses Python's built-in eval() function for evaluation. Avoid modifying the code to take input from untrusted sources, as eval() can execute arbitrary code.
